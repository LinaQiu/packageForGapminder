Description: While we take a look into pop/lifeExp/gdpPercap and year in dataset GAPMINDER,
    we would want to find is there any linear relationship them. The existing
    function lm() can help us fit a linear model between them, but it only returns
    coefficients of the fitted linear model. However sometimes, we not only want
    to see the coefficients of the fitted linear model, but also want to check the
    residuals and how well the data fit the linear model. Thus, this package is
    created to help you find the linear relationship between pop/lifeExp/gdpPercap and time
    for different countries in GAPMINDER easier, as well as to help you get a intuitive view
    on how well country's pop/lifeExp/gdpPercap and year fit the linear model by creating a
    table and plot for the fitted linear model.
