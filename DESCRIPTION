Description: While we take a look into population and time in dataset GAPMINDER,
    we would want to find is there any linear relationship them. The existing
    function lm() can help us fit a linear model between them, but it only returns
    coefficients of the fitted linear model. However sometimes, we not only want
    to see the coefficients of the fitted linear model, but also want to check the
    residuals and how well the data fit the linear model. Thus, this package is
    created to help you find the linear relationship between population and time for
    different countries in GAPMINDER and get a intuitive view on how well country's
    population and time fit the linear model.
